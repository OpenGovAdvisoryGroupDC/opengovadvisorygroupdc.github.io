GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Department of Forensic Sciences

Open Government Report 2014
To institutionalize a culture of transparent and open government, accountability, and to
expand opportunities for resident participation and collaboration, this Report describes
how the Department of Forensic Sciences (DFS) has and will continue to develop and
enhance transparency, public participation, and collaboration. In accordance with
Mayor’s Order 2014-170, this report addresses the following topics:
Transparency


DFS’s Public Information Officer maintains the agency website (dfs.dc.gov)
and Facebook page (www.facebook.com/DCDepartmentofForensicSciences),
regularly posting news and information to both. The website includes an
Open Government and FOIA page that includes to all sorts of DFS
information, including administrative, financial, operational, and public
testimony/meetings. Agency press releases are posted to the website and
Facebook, as well as emailed out to dozens of media outlets.



DFS takes its obligations pursuant to the District’s Freedom of Information
Act and Open Meeting Act seriously. DFS’s General Counsel is the agency’s
FOIA officer and in the most recent fiscal year for which data is available, a
disposition was reached in 100 percent of requests received and was done so
in a median time of 12 days. Links are available on the DFS website that
direct users to a FOIA request form, the agency’s FOIA report, and the results
of FOIA requests filed. Regarding Open Meetings, DFS publishes advance
notice of the quarterly meetings of its Science Advisory Board in the DC
Register and on its website, along with an agenda. After the meetings, notes
are posted in a timely fashion, and a complete audio recording is made
available upon request. Webcasting is under consideration pending
technology review and application.



DFS will regularly consider what public information to provide through
existing and new media, in keeping with its mission and the statute creating
the agency.



DFS is working closely with the Office of the City Administrator (OCA) and the
Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to identify a significant number
of datasets that OCA and OCTO expect to publish online later this year. If no
dataset from DFS is selected to be included in this 2014 release, we will
continue to work with OCA and OCTO to identify datasets appropriate to
publish in 2015. In the future, requirements for open data reporting will be
provided by the Chief Data Officer.

Public Engagement and Participation

All of DFS’s policies and procedures are linked in the agency’s public website.
Commentary/feedback can be sent to contactDFS@dc.gov.

Through its website and Facebook page, DFS gives advance notice of any
community meetings or public hearings in which the agency is participating.
The website also features links to the Director’s testimony at Performance
