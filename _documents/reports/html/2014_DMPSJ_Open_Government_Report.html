GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Office of the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety & Justice

Open Government Report 2014

To institutionalize a culture of transparent and open government, accountability, and to
expand opportunities for resident participation and collaboration, this Report describes
how the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety & Justice has and will continue to
develop and enhance transparency, public participation, and collaboration. In accordance
with Mayor’s Order 2014-170, this report addresses the following topics:
1)

Transparency
The Office of the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety & Justice demonstrates a
commitment to transparency through our website. To share information with the
public, the website has an “Open Government and FOIA” tab. This section
contains awarded contracts, an organizational chart, P card purchases, and budget.
Additionally, the homepage provides links to our cluster agencies and
independent agencies as well as their respective social media platforms. The
Office of the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety& Justice is working closely with
the Office of the City Administrator (OCA) and the Office of the Chief
Technology Officer (OCTO) to identify a significant number of datasets that
OCA and OCTO expect to publish online later this year. If no dataset from Office
of the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety & Justice is selected to be included in the
2014 release, we will continue to work with OCA and OCTO to identify datasets
appropriate to publish in 2015. In the future, requirements for open data reporting
will be provided by the Chief Data Officer.

2)

Public Engagement and Participation

To improve public engagement and participation, the Office of the Deputy Mayor for
Public Safety & Justice uses Twitter, @SafeDC, to share information and resources.
The Twitter handle, @SafeDC, allows for the swift dissemination of relevant
information such as crime alerts, community meetings, public hearings, etc. Also, on
the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety & Justice website,
www.dmspj.dc.gov, there is a link to grade.dc.gov to provide agency specific
feedback.

Collaboration

The Office of the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety& Justice improves the
quality of life for District residents by coordinating and developing
interagency public safety initiatives. To enhance cooperation among
departments, the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice
convenes a monthly meeting with agency directors and biweekly agency
meetings with senior staff of public safety agencies. Additionally, these
meetings are supplemented with community forums, which are highly,
collaborative exercises, designed to help the Office of the Deputy Mayor for
Public Safety & Justice as well as other public safety partners remain abreast
of the public’s concerns.
