GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

Open Government Report 2014

To institutionalize a culture of transparent and open government, accountability, and to
expand opportunities for resident participation and collaboration, this Report describes
how the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) has and will continue to develop and
enhance transparency, public participation, and collaboration. In accordance with
Mayor’s Order 2014-170, this report addresses the following topics:
1)

Transparency
Describe the steps your agency has taken or plans to take to be more transparent.
Please include a description of:


How and to what extent your agency shares information with the public, e.g.
publication of information in the District register and on the agency website,
press releases, and documents in the agency’s FOIAXpress reading room.
OAG is committed to a transparent, open form of government. District agency
websites are required to make certain records available online to the public, if
those records exist. Our website includes links that show information related
to (1) Employee salary information; (2) statements of policy (OAG’s
privileged and confidential legal opinion letters to client agencies are exempt
from disclosure. There are, however, some opinion letters to the ANCs that
are available on our website); (3) Formal, published, OAG/Corporation
Counsel Opinions; (4) OAG's Performance; (5) OAG's Budget; (6) DistrictWide Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) reports; and (7) OAG's
Organizational Chart. We also provide links for the public to provide
feedback to the agency. We also post our press releases and agency testimony
on our website.
OAG’s FOIA requests are issue specific – we do not have categories of
records that are frequently requested. When appropriate, we post documents
in OAG’s FOIAXpress reading room.



How the agency meets its obligations pursuant to the District’s Freedom of
Information Act and Open Meetings Act.
OAG meets its obligations to the District’s FOIA statute by responding timely
to FOIA requests and by providing, when appropriate, as many requested
records as possible. We have a link on our website for the public to submit
FOIA requests via FOIAXpress; we also provide the name and contact
information of the agency’s FOIA officer.
1



Steps your agency will take to increase public access to information.
OAG will continue to process FOIA requests via FOIAXpress and upload as
many records as possible in the public reading room. We will also continue to
post our press releases and agency testimony on our website. In addition,
OAG anticipates discussions with the incoming elected AG (after November
4th) to discuss his/her views on this subject, with a goal of making this nowindependent office a leader in this area.



Steps your agency will take, including an implementation timeline, to webcast
live and archive on the internet board or commission meetings. (This
question only applies to agencies that are overseen or advised by a board or
commission that is subject to the Open Meetings Act.)
OAG is not overseen or advised by a board or commission that is subject to
the Open Meetings Act.



How your agency has taken or plans to take steps to make more of its data
available to the public.
OAG-specific data is provided annually to the Council and the public in
OAG’s responses to performance oversight and budget hearing questions. In
addition, OAG is working closely with the Office of the City Administrator
(OCA) and the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to identify a
significant number of datasets that OCA and OCTO expect to publish online
later this year. If no dataset from OAG is selected to be included in this 2014
release, we will continue to work with OCA and OCTO to identify datasets
appropriate to publish in 2015. In the future, requirements for open data
reporting will be provided by the Chief Data Officer.

2)

Public Engagement and Participation
Describe the steps your agency has taken or plans to take to enhance or expand
opportunities for the public to participate in agency decision-making. Please include
a description of:


How your agency provides online access to proposed rules and regulations
and secures public input on them. Please list links to specific websites.
OAG, through its Legal Counsel Division, provides legal advice and
assistance to other District government agencies on their proposed rules and
regulations. Since the legal advice we provide is legally privileged and
confidential, we do not post it on our website. Additionally, much of OAG’s
responsibility is to provide legal support and advice to other agencies, thereby
allowing fewer opportunities for it to directly engage members of the public.
2

There are, however, programs (child support collections, establishment and
enforcement of support orders; juvenile justice and consumer protection, for
example) that do directly involve DC residents. These interactions often
provide informal opportunities to hear from the public as well.


How your agency shares information and resources to keep the public
properly informed, e.g. community meetings, public hearings, FAQs, and
ways the public can provide input such as Twitter, grade.dc.gov, email
contacts.
OAG puts out press releases on significant matters we are handling, which are
made available on OAG’s website. In addition, we provide website links to
materials related to a variety of topics including: (1) Driving Under the
Influence; (2) Ethics Standards; (3) Housing Code Violations; (4) Legal
Services Rules; and (5) OAG/Corporation Counsel Opinions. Finally, we
provide two ways for the public to provide feedback – they can email OAG or
fill out the “Ask the Attorney General” form and submit anonymously.
In addition, OAG promptly answers questions of local and national media,
including bloggers, as well as private citizens, although we do not provide
legal advice to private parties. This includes making available our court filings
that might not be easily obtainable elsewhere.



How your agency identifies stakeholders and invites their participation.
As an agency that supports others in the city government, our efforts are often
derivative, meaning that our legal advice and litigation support often enables
other agencies with more direct contact with the public to better identify
stakeholders and engage them. Also, in those instances where the OAG is
proposing legislation or supporting legislation proposed by the Mayor or other
agencies, our testimony before the Council and legal sufficiency reviews often
spark the interests of other stakeholders in the subject legislation.



Steps your agency will take to improve public engagement and participation
including any new feedback tools or mechanisms the agency is considering.
As noted, OAG anticipates discussions with the incoming elected AG (after
November 4th) to discuss his/her views on this subject, with a goal of making
this now-independent office a leader in this area.

3)

Collaboration
Describe the steps your agency has taken or plans to take to enhance or expand
cooperation among departments, other governmental agencies, the public, and nonprofit and private entities in fulfilling its obligations. Please include a description of:

3



How your agency currently collaborates with the above parties. Please list
links to specific websites if appropriate.
OAG is the legal arm of the District government. Our main obligation is to
represent the municipal corporation of the District of Columbia to ensure that
it receives the best legal advice and representation and at the same time seek
justice and pursue the rule of law in the best interest of the residents of the
District of Columbia. To that end, we represent the District, its officials and
employees in both the local and federal courts in the city’s affirmative and
defensive litigation. OAG pursues consumer protection and anti-trust matters,
oversees child support enforcement and collections, and handles abuse and
neglect cases for child and adult victims who are the city’s legal
responsibility.
We also represent the District in its juvenile prosecutions, pursue criminal
convictions for some adult misdemeanor offenses, including traffic and
impaired driving cases.
In addition, we give legal advice to District of Columbia government officials
on a broad range of topics, including real estate, economic development and
zoning issues as well as on constitutional matters and other legal questions.
We work closely with the Mayor, agency directors, and agency counsel to
ensure that we provide the best possible legal advice and litigation support,
understanding that aspects of this often serve a risk-management benefit for
the city government as well.



Steps your agency will take to improve collaboration with the above parties
including any new feedback tools or mechanisms the agency is considering,
e.g. prizes, competitions, and other innovative methods.
As noted, OAG anticipates discussions with the incoming elected AG (after
November 4th) to discuss his/her views on this subject, with a goal of making
this now-independent office a leader in this area.
