GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
D.C. Department of Corrections

Open Government Report 2014

To institutionalize a culture of transparent and open government, accountability, and to
expand opportunities for resident participation and collaboration, this report describes
how the D.C. Department of Corrections (DC DOC) has and will continue to develop and
enhance transparency, public participation, and collaboration. In accordance with
Mayor’s Order 2014-170, this report addresses the following topics:
1)

Transparency







DC DOC shares information with the public through a variety of sources,
including but not limited to the agency website (including the Open
Government section), e-mail, press releases and media advisories (featured on
our website and disseminated to the media), our Facebook and Tumblr
accounts, and our newly activated Twitter account. These sources allow us to
make the public aware of agency resources, inform them of ongoing and/or
special agency activities, keep them updated on services and programs, and
showcase many of the forums and ceremonial events held throughout the year.
Our Facebook account, in particular, allows us to dialogue with the public in
ways we were never able to do so in the past. We have also released important
documents such as our 2014 Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) report and
our comprehensive report on Suicide Prevention, both of which can be found
on the DCDOC website.
In keeping with the required protocols for responding to FOIA requests, DC
DOC responds to all within the designated time frame. We have also begun
use of FOIA Express which streamlines the request and response processes.
DC DOC will continue to use our website along with social media to increase
public access to agency information. We went “live” with our Twitter
account this week and plan to use it as another way to share up-to-date
information about the department. Also, as with our Facebook page, Twitter
will allow us real time access to the public and any questions or concerns they
have about our operations.
DC DOC is working closely with the Office of the City Administrator (OCA)
and the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to identify a
significant number of datasets that OCA and OCTO expect to publish online
later this year. If no dataset from the D.C. Department of Corrections is
selected to be included in this 2014 release, we will continue to work with
OCA and OCTO to identify datasets appropriate to publish in 2015. In the
future, requirements for open data reporting will be provided by the Chief
Data Officer.

Public Engagement and Participation

3)

The D.C. Department of Corrections uses its social media accounts
(Facebook, Tumblr, and recently Twitter) as a supplement to the agency
website to keep the public informed. On the website, we also have the Ask the
Director section available for feedback and questions from the public.
DC DOC has quarterly meetings with stakeholder groups including our
Citizens Advisory Committee (a volunteer committee of external partners who
advise the agency on community feedback), the Transgender Advisory
Committee (which includes representatives from the transgender and
advocacy communities, medical and security staff, and executive leadership),
Linking Institutions Neighborhoods and Communities - LINCS (our corps of
volunteer organizations that collectively provide a wide range of pre and post
release services and support to the offender population and correctional staff,
as well as our Faith Based Advisory Council (a diverse group of clergy that
provide pre- release and community support and advise the Agency Director
on operational and programmatic matters). The Department also interfaces
regularly with the Corrections Information Council – CIC, and is an active
member of the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council and its subcommittees.
DC DOC expects that the recently established Twitter account will be another
major way for our agency to improve public engagement and participation. In
addition to dialogue through the Twitter account, we will continue to receive
feedback from the quarterly meetings with our stakeholders and community
groups.

Collaboration


DC DOC currently collaborates with several community groups and advisory
councils in an effort to receive feedback, but also to disseminate information
about the department. The agency meets with these groups at least on a
quarterly basis.
These groups include:
o The Citizens Advisory Committee: http://doc.dc.gov/node/563382
o The Transgender Advisory Committee:
http://doc.dc.gov/page/transgender-advisory-committee
o Criminal Justice Coordinating Council: http://cjcc.dc.gov/
o Corrections Information Council: http://cic.dc.gov/
o Faith-based community organizations
o Linking Institutions Neighborhoods and Communities (LINCS)
