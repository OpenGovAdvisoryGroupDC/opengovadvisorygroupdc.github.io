GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Department of Consumer and Regularity Affairs

Open Government Report 2014

To institutionalize a culture of transparent, open government and accountability and to expand
opportunities for resident participation and collaboration, this Report describes how the
Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) has and will continue to develop and
enhance transparency, public participation, and collaboration. In accordance with Mayor’s Order
2014-170, this report addresses the following:
1)

Transparency

The Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs has taken the following steps to be more
transparent:
•

Promotion of Green Building Program, including LEED accreditation and increased
public outreach on the benefits of green construction

•

Implementation of new vending regulations, resulting in a more predictable and
transparent licensing and site-assignment process

•

Simplification of trade name process, consolidating trade name registration under one
agency for license application renewals

•

Establishment of a new, streamlined Basic Business License process for one and twofamily rentals with self-certification

•

Online submission of plans through ProjectDox, an innovative web application
streamlining the review process

•

Creation of an online Permit Intake Validation System (PIVS), which provides the public
a one-stop shop for key information on a particular address, including property
ownership, zoning, building permit issued, business licenses, and property code citations

•

Increase in online/mobile services such as Business License Verification, E-Corp,
Business License Renewal, and Building Permit Applications

•

Reduction in paper support of DCRA ‘Paperless Permitting Initiative – today 100% of
building permit applications are completed via the Online Construction Permit
Application Intake System (OCPI)



Steps your agency will take to increase public access to information.
DCRA is currently working to create a One City Portal – which is an integrated licensing and
information system that will allow other government agencies and the public to communicate
with each other in real time.



How your agency has taken or plans to take steps to make more of its data available to the
public.

DCRA is working closely with the Office of the City Administrator (OCA) and the Office of the
Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to identify a significant number of datasets that OCA and
OCTO expect to publish online later this year. Currently, several sets of the agency’s data are
available at data.dc.gov.

2)

Public Engagement and Participation

Describe the steps your agency has taken or plans to take to enhance or expand opportunities for
the public to participate in agency decision-making. Please include a description of:


How does your agency provide online access to proposed rules and regulations and secures
public input on them. Please list links to specific websites.

The agency publishes any emergency, proposed, or final rules in the District of Columbia
Register, which is available to the public online at dcregs.dc.gov. As part of the proposed
rulemakings, members of the public are provided with at least 30 days to submit comments. The
process for submitting comments is included at the end of all proposed rulemakings.
Links to some other regulations may be found at: http://dcra.dc.gov/page/regulations-dcra.
The Construction Codes Coordinating Board (CCCB) provides the opportunity for members of
the public to submit code change proposals, and to participate in technical advisory groups
(TAGs) that make recommendations to the CCCB on code changes. In the last code cycle,
completed in March 2014, hundreds of people and organizations, representing industry, design
professionals, residents, and other stakeholders, participated in the code development process.
More information about the CCCB and the TAGS is provided on the DCRA website at:
http://dcra.dc.gov/service/construction-codes-coordinating-board


How does your agency share information and resources to keep the public properly
informed, e.g. community meetings, public hearings, FAQs, and ways the public can
provide input such as Twitter, grade.dc.gov, email contacts.

The public can access almost all permitting and licensing information twenty-four hours per day,
seven days a week on DCRA’s PIVS system.
The agency also responds to inquiries and concerns raised via Twitter, grade.dc.gov, and email.
The DCRA website offers a wealth of information for the public on how to get a business license
or for background on permitting. For example, checklists are available on the DCRA website
showing all the documentation that is required to a secure a business license, so that an
applicant can quickly identify requirements.
DCRA also currently participates in Advisory Neighborhood Commission(ANC) meetings,
community open houses, and permit stakeholder meetings.

3

DCRA uses ward based inboxes to share information with the public. The ward based inboxes
are email accounts that were created for the sole purpose of accommodating the high demands of
staff members from the Executive Mayors Office, Council offices, and the District’s ANCs.
These inboxes range from 1-8 (one for each ward of the city). With this system, constituents can
expect excellent customer service, fast response times, and a personal agency liaison to address
questions and concerns.
In addition, to the ward-based inboxes, DCRA uses the IQ system , which is a citywide database
used to collect concerns, questions, and inquires from the residents of DC. All DCRA-related IQ
inquires come in through resources such as “Ask the Director” on the DCRA website, the email
address housinginspections@dc.gov, the email address dcra@dc.gov, or through the 311 call
center.


How does your agency identify stakeholders and invite their participation.

DCRA identifies stakeholders as being residents, business owners, district and federal
government agencies and visitors seeking to do business in the District. Agency management
(including the director), readily make themselves available for meetings with stakeholders.


Steps your agency will take to improve public engagement and participation including any
new feedback tools or mechanisms the agency is considering.

DCRA has one of the District governments most popular Twitter accounts with more than 7,000
followers. The agency will continue to use feedback from Twitter in addition to feedback
received through more traditional means.
The agency is implementing an online permitting submission and review system that gives permit
applicants easier access to feedback on discipline reviews. DCRA is also looking at expanding
personalized service programs like the Small Business Resource Center, so that customers are
assigned a single point of contact, which should allow feedback to reach its desired source more
quickly and effectively.

3)

Collaboration

Describe the steps your agency has taken or plans to take to enhance or expand cooperation
among departments, other governmental agencies, the public, and non-profit and private entities
in fulfilling its obligations. Please include a description of:


How your agency currently collaborates with the above parties. Please list links to specific
websites if appropriate.

Currently, DCRA collaborates with the above parties by way of the Small Business Resource
Center (SBRC). The Small Business Resource Center is designed to provide one-on-one
technical assistance, educational assistance, and group workshops to future and current business
owners seeking to navigate through the District’s regulatory environment. Through the SBRC,
DCRA has established partnerships with both the private sector and District and federal
government agencies. Partnerships play a critical role in providing small business education
assistance to SBRC customers. The SBRC is a key initiative among the efforts of the District to
become a more business-friendly jurisdiction.
DCRA’s SBRC continues to build partnerships which contribute to increasing agency and
communication transparency through its outreach efforts. The SBRC demonstrates the collective
efforts by District agencies and private sector partners to provide a platform for entrepreneurs to
receive one-on-one consultations and group workshops. The goal is that entrepreneurs will be
educated to start their businesses efficiently and in compliance with all of the District’s
regulatory requirements. The SBRC is a prime example of DCRA moving aggressively towards
streamlining business regulatory processes, enhancing transparency and communication, and
providing good customer service to the small business community.
