As an office within the Executive Office of the Mayor, Serve DC – The Mayor’s
Office on Volunteerism is working closely with the Office of the City
Administrator (OCA) and the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to
identify a significant number of datasets that OCA and OCTO expect to publish

Volunteerism is selected to be included in this 2014 release, we will continue to
