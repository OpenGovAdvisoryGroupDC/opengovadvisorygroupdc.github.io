To institutionalize a culture of transparent and open government, accountability, and to
expand opportunities for resident participation and collaboration, this Report describes
how the Office of Women’s Policy & Initiatives has and will continue to develop and
enhance transparency, public participation, and collaboration. In accordance with
Mayor’s Order 2014-170, this report addresses the following topics:

collaboration with the DC Commission for Women. These meetings
are announced through the District register.

Steps your agency will take to increase public access to information.

information stated above. In addition, our goal is to produce monthly
newsletters beginning October 2014 that will be distributed through
our list serve. Minute notes will also be included on the website for

OWPI is working closely with the Office of the City Administrator (OCA)

significant number of datasets that OCA and OCTO expect to publish online
later this year. If no dataset from OWPI is selected to be included in this 2014

appropriate to publish in 2015. In the future, requirements for open data
reporting will be provided by the Chief Data Officer.”
