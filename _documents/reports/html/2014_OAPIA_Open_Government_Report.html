Public Engagement and Participation

community-based organizations (CBOs) and partners to gather community input. OAPIA
engages the AAPI community at community meetings and events and through agency
activities. OAPIA invites the participation of these stakeholders by informing them through
3
 

online engagement, the agency’s website, the agency’s listserv, and the use of social media,
and through direct engagement through phone banking, door to door outreach, and
partnerships with ethnic media and CBOs.

towards specific groups (e.g. youth, LEPs, non-LEPs). And utilize in-language email lists to
target groups that may not use social media nor visit the agency website.

information distribution (e.g. print material, door-to-door outreach, phone calls) to ensure
that all individuals of all ages, including those with language and cultural barriers, are
involved.

Collaboration

9. OAPIA enhances and expands collaboration among departments and other governmental
agencies, whenever applicable/possible. OAPIA utilizes partnerships with departments and
other government agencies to better:
• Promote programs, services, and job opportunities to the Asian American and Pacific
Islander (AAPI) community and general public.
o Traditional outreach (e.g. events, workshops, community meetings, door-todoor outreach).
o Online outreach (e.g. weekly community updates to the listserv, website
updates, and social media postings).
• Bring a wider range of services and government information to the AAPI community
through formal and direct Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreements and
working partnerships.
• Share District government agency resources and equipment for OAPIA functions and
events.
• Receive assistance in resolving AAPI constituent cases in which a particular District
government agency is the subject matter expert.
• Ensure that AAPI community members receive timely access to District government
services by connecting them with the appropriate point of contact.
OAPIA provides assistance to other agencies in implementing the Language Access Act of
2004 to increase their capacity to serve linguistically and culturally isolated AAPI
community members through data collection, outreach, personnel hiring, cultural
competency, and technical assistance:
• OAPIA sends available data and resources about the AAPI community to District
government agency Language Access Coordinators.
• Recommendations are provided by OAPIA on identifying top AAPI community
issues.
• OAPIA engages in cultural sensitivity training with other District government
agencies.
• OAPIA works with other agencies in developing language access policies and in
developing their biennial language access plans.
o This begins with developing a language access work plan based on a survey about
the previous year and what agencies would like to see OAPIA support them in for
the upcoming year.
o Once a work plan is established, OAPIA distributes it to the agencies and works
on the joint and individual projects throughout the year – this evaluation/survey is
then repeated at the end of the year.
• The recent support OAPIA provided to assist other agencies regarding language
access can be found on the agency website in the form of reports and resources at
http://apia.dc.gov/page/resources-agencies.
• OAPIA also provides quality control services for other governmental agencies as it
pertains to document translation on a case by case basis.

10. Among the public, and non-profit and private entities, OAPIA engages in partnerships with
community-based organizations, community leaders, and community stakeholders. OAPIA
utilizes partnerships with these entities to better:
• Identify and address key community concerns and issues.
• Plan and promote community engagement activities and events that reach a wider
audience, such as the Hate Crime Bias Task Force and Crime Victim Assistance
Partnerships.
• Disseminate Asian language information on government programs and services to the
community, particularly amongst ethnic media partners.
• Recruit office interns that support the agency’s mission to support and engage the
community.
• Recruit speakers, guests, and other resources for OAPIA functions and events.
• Recruit bilingual and general volunteers for OAPIA functions and events, particularly
amongst youth and young professional organizations.
• Resolve cases involving non-governmental services or cases that fall outside the
scope of government.
OAPIA seeks in-kind donations for agency programs from these entities and submits a
donation application form first to the Office of Partnerships and Grants (OPGS) and receives
their approval before soliciting donations. Once approved, OAPIA requires donors to sign a
donation agreement form and submits the form to OPGS for record keeping purposes.
Additionally, OAPIA annually awards funding in the form of grants to eligible communitybased organizations (CBOs) providing direct services to the District’s AAPI community.
• The community grants support CBOs in increasing their capacity to provide high
level, supplemental services to the AAPI population.
• OAPIA also works with these CBOs to improve the sustainability of the organizations
to reduce their dependence on government funds and to increase their ability to
provide a high level of services on their own.
• More information on grants: http://apia.dc.gov/service/oapia-community-grants.

11. OAPIA will take the following steps to improve collaboration with government agencies,
public, private, and non-profit entities. Overall, OAPIA will engage with governmental
agencies and private entities to gauge how to strengthen relationships and to maximize the
effectiveness of serving the community, while reducing costs. Specifically, OAPIA intends
to:
• Conduct stakeholder meetings and discussion on a more frequent basis.
• Explore the possibility of conducting an end of the year survey with community
leaders and stakeholders on OAPIA services and soliciting suggestions on ideas for
collaboration in the future.
• Allow for other avenues of soliciting feedback (e.g. online surveys). Currently,
OAPIA collects input and feedback on agency services and future areas of
engagement. This helps all parties involved to identify potential collaborative projects
6
 

and mutual interests which will benefit the AAPI community, and thereby improve
existing programs and services, and increase capacity.
Among government agencies, OAPIA will:
• Focus on language access by first examining their biennial language access plans and
targeting two main areas of data and outreach.
• Explore methods to make data even more accessible to obtain, and in processing and
understanding of the data.
• Identify events and areas where there can be room for collaboration and thus involve
other governmental agencies.
• Identify the resources needed and expand the informal partnerships for OAPIA
agency events that may not be accompanied with a MOU, but rather through
increased correspondence.
Among non-profits, OAPIA will:
• Examine with regards to grants, capacity building resources offered by the District.
• Identify external resources and compile them for use by nonprofit stakeholders.
• Explore methods of developing resources with nonprofit stakeholders that will
increase their capacity to serve District residents and increase their sustainability.
• Allocate funding that nonprofits can use for capacity building. OAPIA will work
together to identify areas and programs that nonprofits can take advantage of that are
relevant to their organization.
