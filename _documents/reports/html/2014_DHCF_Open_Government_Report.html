GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Department of Health Care Finance

Open Government Report 2014
Introduction
The Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) is the agency responsible for the
administration of the Medicaid, CHIP, Alliance Health Care and other programs. The
mission of DHCF is to improve health outcomes by providing access to comprehensive,
cost-effective, and quality health care services for D.C residents.
To institutionalize a culture of transparent and open government, accountability, and to
expand opportunities for resident participation and collaboration, this Report describes
how the Department of Health Care Finance has and will continue to develop and
enhance transparency, public participation, and collaboration. In accordance with
Mayor’s Order 2014-170, this report addresses the following topics:
1)

Transparency
Below is a description of the steps DHCF has taken or plans to take to be more
transparent in the areas of: covered Medicaid services in DC; how to apply for
Medicaid in the District; the program policies for Medicaid and CHIP; grants and
cooperative agreements to DHCF; FOIA activities; and access to meetings and data.
A. Medicaid Covered Services Offered by DHCF in the District of Columbia




DHCF is the single state agency responsible for the administration of services
covered under title XIX (Medicaid) and Title XXI (Child Health Insurance
Program, or CHIP) of the Social Security Act, as amended. Covered
Medicaid services fall into two categories: mandatory and optional services.
While the mandatory services are the same across all states and jurisdictions,
the optional services are independently determined by each jurisdiction. The
DHCF website (http://dhcf.dc.gov/service/medicaid) contains descriptive
information of the Medicaid services covered by the Medicaid program in the
District of Columbia and how to apply for Medicaid in the District of
Columbia (http://dhcf.dc.gov/page/medical-assistance-programs-informationand-eligibility).
DHCF intends to also provide a link to the CMS website that will allow DC
residents to identify and compare the services offered by Medicaid agencies in
other jurisdictions to those offered by DC (http://www.medicaid.gov/stateresource-center/medicaid-state-plan-amendments/medicaid-state-planamendments.html).

B. Medicaid and CHIP Program Policies

DHCF maintains on its website an electronic copy of the Medicaid State Plan
(http://dhcf.dc.gov/page/dhcf-medicaid-regulations) that contains all of the
policies for the Medicaid program. A Medicaid State Plan is an agreement
between a state (or other jurisdiction, like the District) and the Federal
government describing how the jurisdiction administers its Medicaid
program. In DC, CHIP is accomplished through a Medicaid expansion and a
copy of the CHIP Plan and Amendments is available on the Federal Website
(http://medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/ByTopics/Childrens-Health-Insurance-Program-CHIP/CHIP-State-ProgramInformation.html?filterBy=District of Columbia). The Plans provide an
assurance that a jurisdiction will abide by Federal rules and may claim
Federal matching funds for its program activities. The State Plan sets out
groups of individuals to be covered, services to be provided, methodologies
for providers to be reimbursed and the administrative activities that are
currently approved for that jurisdiction.
Changes to the State Plan are done through the State Plan Amendment (SPA)
Process and must be ultimately approved by the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS). Before DHCF submits a SPA to CMS, DHCF
publishes the proposed SPA in the District Register to allow for comments by
affected parties (http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/). Copies of local rule-making that
support the State Plan Amendments are also published in the District Register
for public comment before approval.
Transmittals are documents that provide guidance to the enrolled providers
or services to Medicaid beneficiaries. DHCF shares copies of our
Transmittals on our website (http://dhcf.dc.gov/page/2014-dhcf-medicaidupdates) so they are accessible to all providers and consumers of services, as
well as the general public.
DHCF intends to provide a link on our website to the CMS website where
providers and consumers can compare policy documents from other Medicaid
State Agencies in other jurisdictions (http://medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIPProgram-Information/By-State/By-State.html) to the District’s policy
documents.

C. Medicaid Grants and Cooperative Agreements




DHCF has been the recipient of several federal grants and cooperative
agreements over the past five years in the areas of health information
exchange, health information technology, health insurance exchange
planning and health care reform. DHCF announces the award of these
through press releases coordinated through the Executive Office of the Mayor
(EOM).
For some of the grants and cooperative agreements, funds were included to
pay for information dissemination activities to let the public know what
activities transpired or were being planned in the grant or cooperative
agreement. Activities such as the HIE Stakeholder Summit
(September 2014) provided an opportunity to share accomplishments and

future plans of the cooperative agreement at a local Summit conducted by
DHCF at no charge to the participants.
D. Freedom of Information and FOIAXpress Reading Room Activities






DHCF is committed to a transparent and open form of government. The
agency makes certain records available online through its website
(www.dhcf.dc.gov), including public employee salary information, fiscal year
budget, policy statements, and numerous frequently requested public records.
In addition, publically released documents can be accessed via the DC
Government’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Reading Room
(https://foia-dc.gov/palMain.aspx). For records that are not available online
the public is invited to submit a FOIA request through the DC government
Public FOIA Portal (https://foia-dc.gov/palMain.aspx).
DHCF complies with all the legal requirements of FOIA. When the FOIA
Officer receives a FOIA request he informs the requestor that it has been
received and that the agency has 15 business days to respond. The request is
then evaluated to ensure that it is seeking information that falls within FOIA’s
disclosure requirements. It is important to note that FOIA only applies to
documents already in existence; no new records are to be created in response
to a FOIA request. The request is then funneled to the appropriate agency
representative to collect the necessary documentation. If the documents
requested exist they are collected and evaluated to determine if they fall
within any of the statutorily listed exemptions, such as trade secrets, personal
information that would constitute an invasion of privacy, investigatory
records compiled for law enforcement purposes, etc. (see D.C. Municipal
Regulations Title I, 1-406 (2014)). If the documents do not fall within any
exemption then they are sent to the requestor, either electronically or through
the U.S. postal service.
DHCF is committed to open and transparent government. It will continue to
strive to provide the public with access to relevant information concerning the
agency’s operations.

E. Open Meeting Act Activities


DHCF

DHCF has one advisory board (DC HIE Advisory Board) whose members are
appointed and sworn in through the Mayor’s Office of Boards and
Commissions. DHCF also has two advisory committees (the Medical Care
Advisory Committee and the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee), and an
advisory council (Ombudsman Advisory Council) whose members are
appointed by the State Medicaid Director, or by their designee. These groups
provide advice to the agency in a number of areas: Health Information
Exchange, Medical Care Services, Pharmacy and Therapeutics, and
Insurance Advocacy. Notices of the meetings are posted in advance and the
meetings are open to the public.

DHCF is exploring the technology and logistics requirements that would be
necessary in order to webcast the advisory board meetings and archive the
past meetings for public consumption.

F. Access to Medicaid Data





2)

As a covered entity under HIPAA, DHCF has a mandated responsibility to
protect the privacy and security of beneficiary information. However DHCF
can provide aggregate and de-identified data to interested parties.
The Division of Analytics and Policy Research (DAPR), within the Health
Care Policy and Research Administration (HCPRA) at DHCF, regularly
produces data snapshots on recent analyses of costs and utilization of
Medicaid services among beneficiaries in the District of Columbia. Snapshots
recently posted to the DHCF website have covered a variety of topics,
including insurance coverage levels among children in the District; the effect
of the Medicaid expansion on Medicaid Managed Care enrollment; and the
cost of Mental Health Rehabilitation Services (MHRS). By sharing these
snapshots on the DHCF website, the agency seeks to engage the public
interest in timely health care policy issues, and provide a transparent view of
the work DHCF conducts to serve Medicaid beneficiaries of the District of
Columbia.
DHCF is working closely with the Office of the City Administrator (OCA) and
the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to identify a significant
number of datasets that OCA and OCTO expect to publish online later this
year. If no dataset from DHCF is selected to be included in this 2014 release,
we will continue to work with OCA and OCTO to identify datasets
appropriate to publish in 2015. In the future, requirements for open data
reporting will be provided by the DHCF Chief Data Officer.

Public Engagement and Participation
To enhance or expand opportunities for the public to participate in agency decisionmaking, DHCF has taken the following steps:






For the SPA-related documents and Transmittals that were previously
discussed under Transparency, DHCF currently uses the District Register’s
public comment process to provide for public engagement, participation and
input on the approval process for these policy documents. URL:
http://lims.dccouncil.us/
DHCF publishes on its website (http://dhcf.dc.gov/) advance notices of public
meetings of: the Medical Care Advisory Committee (MCAC), DC HIE
Advisory Board, and the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, and the
Ombudsman’s Advisory Council. Minutes are taken at these meetings and
can, in most instances, be made available to the public, on request.
The MCAC holds a standing monthly meeting to share DHCF program
initiatives and to obtain public and stakeholder input. DHCF maintains both

Facebook and Twitter accounts and links to them through the DHCF website
for social media interactions. DHCF also participates in the “Ask the
Director” program to answer questions from the public posted to the website.
For the existing committees and advisory boards, suggestions for additional
stakeholders often come from the current stakeholders or externally from
individuals who self-refer after learning about the group. Additional
participation can also come in the form of ad-hoc working groups or tasks
forces that are augmented by participants who are not formally on the full
board or committee.

Collaboration
DHCF has taken or plans to take the following steps to enhance or expand
cooperation among departments, other governmental agencies, the public, and nonprofit and private entities to fulfill our mission:
A. Intergovernmental Collaboration










DHCF

DHCF works with DHS and the DCHBX on a multi-year project to design
and deploy a new integrated eligibility system for health and human services
programs. The system is called the DC ACCESS SYSTEM or DCAS. During
the first phase of the project, DHCF, DHS and DCHBX developed the needed
functionality to automate and streamline eligibility for Medicaid and the DC
Health Benefits Exchange in compliance with the Affordable Care Act and to
build the health benefits website, DC Healthlink. DHCF and DHS continue to
work together to automate and streamline eligibility for all remaining health
and human services programs.
DHCF has several intergovernmental collaborations with sister agencies for
the purpose of improving the delivery of services to Medicaid beneficiaries to
ultimately improve health care outcomes and/or the quality of life. Current
collaborations include DOH, DOC, DYRS, DBH, DCOA, CFSA, OSSE,
DCPS, DDS, and DDOE on public health or health care delivery projects.
DHCF has collaborated with DOH on health information technology (IT)
projects that enable the improved collection of health care information for
public health purposes. The collaboration involved joint participation on an
advisory board and providing a sub-grant from DHCF to DOH to pay for
health IT upgrades to DOH systems.
DHCF is collaborating with DBH on a Medicaid health homes project to
improve the services delivered to Medicaid beneficiaries with severe mental
illness (SMI). This collaboration involved the drafting a Medicaid Health
Homes State Plan Amendment to finance the services.
DHCF, DDS, DCOA, DBH and DHS also successfully collaborated on a
planning grant to the US. Administration for Community Living (ACL) to
develop a No Wrong Door, streamlined referral and eligibility system for
individuals seeking access to long-term care services and supports. The focus

of the grant is to strengthen the services offered by the ADRC and to build
upon the functionality of DCAS.
B. Private Sector Provider Collaboration






DHCF used federal funding from an Office of the National Coordinator
(ONC) cooperative agreement to fund sub-grants for six District hospitals to
participate in a regional project for an electronic Encounter Notification
System (ENS) which alerts physicians when their patients transition to a
different health care setting.
DHCF is exploring private sector collaborations with evolving
Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and ACO-like entities to improve
the capabilities of these organizations to do care coordination, which will
allow more effective utilization of scarce health care resources. Some of these
collaborations are not just intra-District but may involve regional
collaborations with providers in Maryland locations.
DHCF will also explore ways to inform the public of these collaborations and
how the collaborations can positively affect the health outcomes of consumer
members and beneficiaries.

C. Academic Collaboration




DHCF is collaborating with George Washington University (GWU) on a
federally funded grant GWU received to evaluate the use of mobile
technologies and integrated care systems. This collaboration will involve
data sharing and analysis of linked data to determine the impact of
technology on selected health outcomes. Another public sector agency will be
involved in this collaboration as well.
DHCF will be examining new tools in data collaboration to help improve the
timely communication of progress in the analysis of the data and the accurate
interpretation of research implications.

Conclusion
DHCF intends to update this Open Government Report annually to include new and
emerging initiatives that demonstrate transparency, engagement, and collaboration in the
agency and that would be of interest to our stakeholders and to the public at large.
