GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Office of Contracting and Procurement

Open Government Report 2014

To institutionalize a culture of transparent and open government, accountability, and to
expand opportunities for resident participation and collaboration, this Report describes
how the Office of Contracting and Procurement has and will continue to develop and
enhance transparency, public participation, and collaboration. In accordance with
Mayor’s Order 2014-170, this report addresses the following topics:
1)

Transparency
In FY14, transparency was a top priority for the Office of Contracting and
Procurement. The overarching goal was to build on the publicly reported data that
OCP currently shares to provide the public with better insight as to how OCP spends
taxpayer dollars on behalf of District agencies. For several years, OCP has made the
following data sets publicly available: purchase orders, purchase card transactions,
notices of contract award, and notices of intent to award sole source contracts.
In FY14, OCP started the following initiatives in an effort to improve transparency:
• In conjunction with OCTO, the agency’s website was reorganized to make it
more user-friendly and the information more readily accessible to our
customers.
• The OCP IT team created a link between the Procurement Automated
Support System and the OCP website to automatically publish awarded
contracts to the website. The training manuals and sessions for the staff and
the legal team are almost complete and the official rollout is expected in the
next 60 to 90 days.
In FY15, OCP will continue its work to advance transparency in compliance with the
Procurement Practices Reform Act of 2010 and to improve overall understanding of
the contracting process.

Public Engagement and Participation
Rules and Regulations
The rules and regulations that guide OCP’s work are the 27 DC Municipal
Regulations and the Procurement Practices Reform Act of 2010, and are posted on the
OCP website here and here. OCP follows standard procedures for promulgating all
proposed rule changes in the DC Register for the 30 day comment period.

Stakeholder Engagement
The OCP Customer Contact Center (CCC) is the primary point-of-contact for the
vendor community and our agency customers. The CCC team provides general
information to vendors, technical support, and vendor education.
On a monthly basis, OCP offers two workshops to provide vendors an understanding
of how to do business with the District, namely the General Vendor Workshop and
the DC Supply Schedule workshop. These workshops provide a general overview of
the procurement process, the basic requirements for a vendor to meet to do business
with the District, and the application process for the DC Supply Schedule. OCP
partners with the Department of Small and Local Business Development to facilitate
the workshops.
In addition to the vendor workshops offered by OCP, the agency also participated in
over 10 community events aimed at introducing the vendor community to doing
business with the District. These events included:
• Councilmember Vincent Orange’s Small Business Summit;
• Greater Brookland Business Association monthly meeting;
• Fort Myer Small Business Roundtable
• Second Annual DC to Africa: Growing Local, Going Global Business
Symposium; and
• National Black Business League Annual ProBiz Conference, among others.
In FY14, OCP also targeted the Certified Business Enterprise (CBE) community to
introduce two programs that are growing rapidly:
• Surplus Property – The OCP Surplus Property program auctions gently
used furniture, office supplies and equipment, vehicles, and other items
that have been surplused from District government agencies as well as
provides District-based 8A firms and non-profit organizations access to
the federal surplus property program. In FY14, the Surplus Property
program organized three roundtables to introduce non-profit organizations
and the CBE community to the surplus property available to them through
OCP.
• Sustainable Purchasing – In FY14, another major project was the
development of sustainable purchasing specifications and policies to
inform some purchasing decisions. In December 2013, OCP, in
partnership with DSLBD, hosted 35 vendors at a roundtable to gain insight
and feedback from the District’s vendors that offer sustainable products.
In planning for FY15, the priority is to create more opportunities for proactive
engagement with the vendor community and other key stakeholders to educate them
on the procurement process and the programs OCP . One such idea is a reverse trade
fair, which gives small businesses an opportunity to market to District Government
agencies that procure their goods and services. Another idea in the works is to
promote our public facing programs through social media.

3)

Collaboration
In FY14, one of the Chief Procurement Officer’s priorities was eliminating silos that
impede seamless coordination between the procurement office and the agency
program. Accordingly, collaboration is the centerpiece of the procurement reform
initiative OCP has led over the last 18 months. In February 2014, the Chief
Procurement Officer announced the agency’s shift to the Delegated Procurement
Authority model to better support its customer agencies’ procurement needs. Sixty
members of the contracting staff were assigned to 22 customer agencies to serve as
in- house procurement experts. The contracting staff now works closely with the
program and budget teams at customer agencies to plan and execute their
procurement needs. OCP anticipates improved customer satisfaction and potentially
reduced cycle times and improved overall customer satisfaction.
In FY15, OCP’s plan is to regularly measure agency customer satisfaction through a
variety of survey methods. The goal is to make policy and practice decisions based on
real data and feedback from our customers.
