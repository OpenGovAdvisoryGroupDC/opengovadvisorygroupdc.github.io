Open Government Report 2014
	  

	  
To institutionalize a culture of transparent and open government, accountability, and to expand
opportunities for resident participation and collaboration, this Report describes how the Office of the
State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) has and will continue to develop and enhance
transparency, public participation, and collaboration. In accordance with Mayor’s Order 2014-170,
this report addresses the following topics:

Steps to increase public access to Information
Social Media:

Steps to make more of our data available to the public
OSSE is working closely with the Office of the City Administrator (OCA) and the Office of the
Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to identify a significant number of datasets that OCA and OCTO
expect to publish online later this year. If no dataset from OSSE is selected to be included in this
2014 release, we will continue to work with OCA and OCTO to identify datasets appropriate to
publish in 2015. In the future, requirements for open data reporting will be provided by the Chief
Data Officer.
