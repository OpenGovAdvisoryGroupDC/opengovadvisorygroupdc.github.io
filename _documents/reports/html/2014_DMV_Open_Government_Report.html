GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES

Open Government Report 2014
To institutionalize a culture of transparent and open government, accountability, and to
expand opportunities for resident participation and collaboration, this report describes
how the Department of Motor Vehicles (“DC DMV”) has and will continue to develop and
enhance transparency, public participation, and collaboration. In accordance with Mayor’s
Order 2014-170, this report addresses the following topics: Transparency, Public
Engagement and Participation, and Collaboration.
1)

Transparency

The DC DMV’s mission is to promote public safety by ensuring the safe operation of motor
vehicles. DC DMV is committed to establishing and maintaining a system of transparency that
increases the public’s confidence in their government. To achieve this commitment, DC DMV
has taken a number of steps to be more transparent, which include, but are not limited to, the
following:
 DC DMV primarily shares information with the public through its website at
www.dmv.dc.gov, which includes more than 700 pages of information related to
services provided under its three operational program divisions: Adjudication
Services, Driver Services, and Vehicle Services. Additionally, DC DMV proactively
releases data related to ticket issuance and adjudication, revenue, etc. via annual
reports, press releases, driver statistics, links to the D.C official code and municipal
regulations, and ticket hearing dispositions.
 DC DMV offers more than 40 services that can be completed online or through the
mail. By using these services, customers can "skip the trip" to our service center and
conduct DMV business wherever and whenever they choose. Most online services
are available from 6 am to 12 am, seven days a week. However, services such as
vehicle inspection appointment scheduling, is available 24 hours per day.
 DC DMV provides customers with access to a host of online forms/applications from
vehicle registration, tag, and title applications to license/identification, legal, and
medical forms, which can all be downloaded directly from the DC DMV website. In
addition to forms that customers need to complete their transactions, DC DMV
provides informational brochures that explain department policies and procedures.
Some of the more recent brochures include: central issuance of driver licenses and
identification cards and REAL ID and Limited Purpose credentials.
 DC DMV Service Center Waiting Area webcams are available on the DC DMV website
and allow customers to view service center waiting areas prior to visiting a service
1

center from any internet accessible device. Images refresh every 15-30 seconds
during normal business hours.
 For information that cannot be found on the DC DMV Website, the agency
encourages the public to submit a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for
documents via the DC Government Public FOIA Portal at https://foiadc.gov/palMain.aspx. Requests may also be submitted by mail or fax. Additionally,
DC DMV has a dedicated FOIA Officer, who serves as the principal point of contact
within DC DMV for advice and policy guidance on matters pertaining to the
administration of the FOIA.
 The DC DMV is working closely with the Office of the City Administrator (OCA) and
the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to identify a significant number of
datasets that OCA and OCTO expect to publish online later this year. If no dataset
from DC DMV is selected to be included in this 2014 release, we will continue to
work with OCA and OCTO to identify datasets appropriate to publish in 2015. In the
future, requirements for open data reporting will be provided by the Chief Data
Officer.

Public Engagement and Participation

The DC DMV continuously seeks to create innovative ways to enhance or expand opportunities
for the public to engage with agency personnel. These steps include, but are not limited to, the
following:
 The DC DMV shares important information and resources to keep the public
informed through a number of traditional communication mediums, such as
community and ANC listservs and meetings, as well as, social media
communications vehicles. Twitter and Facebook is the most common way that
customers communicate with the DC DMV. The agency’s Twitter (@dcdmv) and
Facebook (@DC Department of Motor Vehicles) accounts are monitored Monday –
Friday from 8am-5pm. The agency sends out a minimum of five tweets per day and
those same tweets are posted to Facebook such that the two are sharing the same
information simultaneously.
Customers have the ability to describe their experience(s) through grade.dc.gov.
This program enables the public to submit comments/feedback. The goal is to help
the DC DMV to improve the quality of its services. Additionally, through the DC
DMV’s Customer Service Survey Program, comment cards are used at each service
center for customers to provide important feedback regarding their experience at
the DC DMV. Most surveys are completed anonymously; however, occasionally,
customers may provide contact information and request a follow-up. In those
instances, a DC DMV representative will reach out to the customer regarding the
issue. The program is designed primarily to measure customer satisfaction and

provide a forum for customers to evaluate their experience and make
recommendations.
 The DC DMV announced the launch of The Parent’s Supervised Driving Program, an
innovative new program sponsored by Ford Motor Company and State Farm
Insurance that is designed to assist teens in becoming safe and responsible drivers.
The curriculum provides parents and guardians with a simple, easy to follow plan.
This free tool optimizes the 50 hours of parental supervised driving required for the
approximately 5,000 District of Columbia teens seeking learner permits each year.
 On May 1, 2014, the DC DMV began issuing a REAL ID Credential and a Limited
Purpose Credential. FAQ’s, a Step-by-Step Process Guide, and a List of Acceptable
Documents brochure was developed and made available to customers by mail,
online, and distributed at each service center. DC DMV Administrators attended
Advisory Neighborhood Council (ANC) meetings and community forums to engage
and inform residents of the new process, and answer questions.
 The DC DMV launched its Online Medical Referral Process. Through this process,
concerned relatives, medical professionals, members of law enforcement and motor
vehicle administrations have a formal process to report drivers whom they feel are
unsafe drivers due to a medical, mental or vision condition.
 On a monthly basis, the DC DMV distributes an e-newsletter to more than 300,000
subscribers. The newsletter contains information about online services, DC DMV
policies and programs, and holiday closings.
3)

Collaboration

DC DMV continues to take steps to enhance or expand cooperation among local and federal
agencies, the public, and non-profit and private entities in fulfilling its obligations. Many of
these initiatives include, but are not limited to, the following:
 In support of a federal initiative, DC DMV implemented a program that waives the
commercial driver license skills test for eligible former military service members.
The requirements include that the person be presently licensed; was employed
within the last 90 days in a military position requiring the operation of a commercial
motor vehicle; and was operating a vehicle representative of the commercial motor vehicle
the applicant operates or expects to operate, for at least the two (2) years immediately
preceding discharge from the military.

 The Ex-Offender Program provides that DC residents released from prison within
the last six (6) months may obtain an identification card free of charge by
submitting an authorized letter from the DC Department of Corrections (DC DOC),
Court Services & Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) or DC Parole and Probation
Agency.

 On a monthly basis, representatives from the DC DMV Adjudication Services and
General Counsel’s office attend an interagency meeting with the Department of
Public Works (DPW), District Department of Transportation (DDOT), Metropolitan
Police Department (MPD), and Office of Unified Communications (OUC) to address
mutual concerns regarding operations, policy, legislative changes, communication,
and customer service as it relates to ticketing and adjudication.
 Representatives from Adjudication Services partner with the Court Services and
Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) to present information at its annual meeting
regarding driver license suspension, revocation, and reinstatement as a result of
DUI charges and other DMV driver license initiatives.
 DC DMV offers assistance to members of the DC Superior Court defense bar with
creating presentation materials regarding DMV consequences of traffic convictions,
non-driving related drug convictions, and CDL violations.
