GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
MAYOR’S OFFICE OF COMMUNITY AFFAIRS
Open Government Report 2014

To institutionalize a culture of transparent and open government, accountability, and to expand
opportunities for resident participation and collaboration, this Report describes how the Mayor’s
Office of Community Affairs has and will continue to develop and enhance transparency, public
participation, and collaboration. In accordance with Mayor’s Order 2014-170, this report
addresses the following topics:
Transparency
The Mayor’s Office of Community Affairs has made it easier for constituents to access
information. This year the office created a “Open Government and FIOA” section on its website
(www.http://ocaf.dc.gov). The page includes user friendly access the following sections: Public
Employee Salary Information, P Card Purchases, District-wide and agency, FOIA Reports,
EOM's FY14 Budget, EOM Regulations and EOM Organizational Chart. OCAF has and will
remain responsive to all requests brought to us by the public.
The Mayor’s Office of Community Affairs is working closely with the Office of the City
Administrator (OCA) and the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) to identify a
significant number of datasets that OCA and OCTO expect to publish online later this year. If no
dataset from [Insert Agency Name] is selected to be included in this 2014 release, we will
continue to work with OCA and OCTO to identify datasets appropriate to publish in 2015. In the
future, requirements for open data reporting will be provided by the Chief Data Officer.

Public Engagement and Participation
The Mayor’s Office of Community Affairs is committed to bring the public’s participation in the
decision-making process. Our office shares information with the public through a number of
ways including list serves, newsletters, community meetings, websites, Twitter, Facebook and
Instagram. OCAF maintains constant contact with stakeholders and invites the public to
participate in their government.
