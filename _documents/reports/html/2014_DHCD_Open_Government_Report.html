o The Architectural Research Institute (ARI) was founded through
collaboration between the University of the District of Columbia and
the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD)
Homestead Preservation Program. The Homestead Preservation Program
is now the Property Acquisition Disposition Division (PADD) and Single
Family Residential Rehabilitation Program (SFRRP). DHCD has been
ARI’s primary client for the past twenty plus years. This collaboration
provides comprehensive architectural services allowing for the
reclamation of the city’s vacant, boarded and run down housing,
rehabilitating them for low- and middle- income residents, thus giving
them the opportunity to become homeowners. Since its inception in 1987,
ARI has provided architectural services on the renovation and
rehabilitation of more than 606 homes and apartments at a cost of more
than S90 million, positively impacting thousands of District residents in
all eights wards of D.C.
The Architectural Research Institute (ARI) provides cross-disciplinary
research and service to support livable, sustainable, global cities. As the
clinical arm of UDC’s Department of Architecture and Community
Development, ARI is tasked with the community service component as
part of the College of Agriculture, Urban Sustainability and
Environmental Sciences, home of the District’s land grant programs.

dies/architectural_research_institute
o Multiple District agencies have programs mitigating health risks posed by
environmental contaminants such as lead, mold, and carbon monoxide.
DHCD worked with DDOE, DCHA, FEMS, and other agencies to catalog
and provide status on environmental health hazards in the District’s
affordable housing stock.
o As part of National Home-Ownership Month, DHCD worked with
community partners to host a housing expo in June 2014. The Expo
provides resources for all residents of the District, including information
for renters, homeowners, potential homeowners, landlords and residents
facing foreclosure. This is a partnership with local CBOs, realtors,
financial institutions, local vendors, service providers and many more.
Activities include hands on demonstrations, classes on financial and
homeownership issues, presentations about DHCD programs and how to
5

access them, and an exhibitor hall with private, public and community
based organizations offering an array of products, services, and programs
for District residents.
o DHCD brought together housing development government and
nongovernmental stakeholders to develop standards for site selection and
urban design which met the standards of Healthy by Design. DHCD then
implemented the Healthy by Design standards for evaluating and selecting
projects for affordable housing.
o PAMD began an initiative to work with Community Based Organizations
(CBO) to provide post-closing counseling as well as work with the Greater
Washington Urban League (GWUL) to ensure client long-term success.
o PADD will work with the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and
Economic Development (DMPED) to identify possible sites for business
incubators as outlined in The 5 year Economic Development Plan.


Steps your agency will take to improve collaboration with the above parties
including any new feedback tools or mechanisms the agency is considering,
e.g. prizes, competitions, and other innovative methods.
o DHCD is consistently working with partner agencies, developers,
community based organizations and residents to continue to
proficiently gauge housing needs, attain innovative ideas and
suggestions and further leverage resources that will allow for the
continued development and preservation of affordable housing for low
and moderate income residents for years to come. This will be done
through various focus groups, community meetings, public hearings,
consolidated Notice of Funding Availability, brain trusts with public
and private entities and a host of other tactics.
